# wordgames

This is a simple wordle-like game to be run in the command line.

It can be run using "python3 src/main.py num_words".

num_words is an optional parameter. It sets how many wordles will be played at one time. For example, if you have ever played quordle (4 words at once), you can simulate that by setting num_words to 4.

In keeping with the pattern set by wordle, quordle, and octordle, you get a number of guesses equal to 5 + num_words.
